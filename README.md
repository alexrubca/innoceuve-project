# innoceuve-project

This is a CRUD example. I use Angular 6 as framework with ES6, HTML5 and SASS with the pattern BEM, Bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome as extern libraries. This example contain the next features:

Functional:
- (Client side) list filtering.
- Implement different screens for each section (list / edition). Using angular router module to access them.
- Form validation using ngx reactive forms techniques.
- Undo feature in edition.
- Server error handling.
- Follow googleâ€™s best practices recommendation for modularization.
- Try to lean on typescript OO features (inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, etc).

Design:
- Custom notifications.
- Sass for CSS generation.
- Responsive design with Bootstrap 4.
- Transitions.
- No data message in empty list.
